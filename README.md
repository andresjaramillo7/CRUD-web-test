# CRUD-web-test

## Description
This project is an enhanced CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application, evolved from a basic version inspired by [FaztCode's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxRXlUrV6y0&t=3496s&ab_channel=FaztCode). It demonstrates CRUD operations with a user-friendly interface, using Node.js and MySQL. Significant improvements include real-time filtering through the database and an update from CommonJS to ES6 module syntax, reflecting modern JavaScript practices.
